            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Mario; a computer science student and a cyber security practitioner. I love
                adventure and challenges; I crave new experiences. Perhaps, that is why I am so fond
                of traveling, trying new foods, and learning new languages. Throughout high school
                the endevors that consumed my time all fell into the same category: puzzles.
            </p>
            <p>Programming, penetration testing, and mathematics are all captivating puzzles; when programming
                you get wrapped in the lines of code, when penetration testing you are enticed to find
                the next exploitable vulnerability, and when you are trying to prove a difficult math
                problem you are entrapped by the mathematics of it all. It was the beautiful world of math
                that gave birth to my love for programming. I will never forget the first time I tested my code
                on the robot that my robotics team had been working on for weeks:
            </p>
            <p><i>We all gathered and I sat there, paralyzed, almost as if it were waiting, the robot jerked forward
                as I pushed the joystick. Everyone lit up with joy, and for me, there are no words to
                describe how it felt to watch it move after countless hours of work. I was in awe at how
                a couple lines of code could produce such tangible results. A physical robot was moving!
            </i></p>
            <p>This is why I enjoy returning to mentor students in my robotics team. I strive to inspire
                students to never settle, to discover, and to seek challenges.
                The endless possibilities and the power of a couple of lines of code led me to a different
                type of puzzle.</p>
            <p>The word hacking has become infamous, too many people think of crime when they hear the word; while in reality,
                hacking is simply the art of creativity. It is the art of solving puzzles that were not meant
                to be solved. Programming has taught me to learn to break things as it can only result
                in an improvement in the following iteration; this is why security leaders perform
                sophisticated adversarial attack simulations. Penetration testing has become a home for
                me as it provides me the ultimate puzzle that requires all my passions to solve; math,
                programming, and technical knowledge.</p>
